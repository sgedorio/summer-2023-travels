                <p>On my first night in Fort Lauderdale, I had a Chicken Tender Pub Sub for the first time since 2019.</p>
                <p>On the walk there, a storm broke out. I started running and randomly passed by a jailhouse. 2 dudes who looked like they just got out stopped me to ask me to use my phone to call their ride. I told them I’m just trying to get a PubSub. It was raining pretty badly so I called their ride who said she was on her way.</p>
                <p>They messed up my mojo a little because I accidentally ordered provolone instead of Swiss.</p>
                <p>3 days after that, while taking a nap at Las Olas Beach after eating another Chicken Tender Pub Sub (Swiss this time), I woke up to a boy screaming in the waters in the distance. I spotted a shark fin about 20 feet away from him.</p>
                <p>A day after that, Twitter’s “For you” algorithm showed me a video of a Russian tourist getting eaten by a shark at an Egyptian beach resort.</p>

Some other car was randomly in the middle of the street blocking us from exiting. The lights were on and we noticed a woman in the driver’s seat passed out cold. We thought she was just taking a nap.</p>
                <p>We started banging on her window to wake her up, but she wasn’t responding. She was breathing though.</p>
                <p>Some girl ran up to us and told us she had already called 911. Seconds later, the ambulance came and the EMT asked us if we wanted to watch him break open her window with a hammer.</p>

                <p>Missouri is known as the “Cave State” even though Tennessee has more of them (M: ~7500, T: 10,000+).</p>
                <p>These caves average 55º-60º F in temperature. I learned that because of this, people in the 19th and 20th centuries partied hard in these caves throughout the sweltering summers, where they drunkenly bludgeoned bats and stalactites.</p>
                <p>I think ambient-heads & Bushwick DJs will discover and repurpose these spaces over the next 100 years.</p>

                <p>Eagle Lake is this beautiful, alpine lake near South Tahoe. You have to hike about an hour along a trail to get there.</p>
                <p>The water was freezing cold because of the massive snowfall earlier this year. It was pretty painful going in but we did it anyways. We ate the BLTs here that we made earlier in the morning.</p>
                <p>It reminded me of the German Alps.</p>
